# 42 Projects 

This repository contains all the projects I completed during my journey at **42**.  
Each project focuses on low-level programming, problem-solving, algorithms, and building a strong understanding of how things work under the hood.

All projects follow **42 Norm**, are written in **C** so far, and are developed/tested in a **Linux environment**.

*For a more detailed description of each project, please refer to the README files in their respective folders within this repository.*
